# Koa.js Boilerplate

This Koa.js boilerplate provides a structured foundation for your project. It separates your code into meaningful modules and implements features like global error handling, response modification, "joi" validation for request bodies, and MongoDB connection.

## Project Structure

The project structure is designed to enhance organization and maintainability.

- The `core` directory contains essential components like middleware, utilities, and database configurations.
- The `httpApi` directory contains modules for defining models, routes, and controllers for your HTTP API.
- `app.js` is the entry point of your application.

## Features

### Global Error Handling

The boilerplate includes global error handling mechanisms to catch and manage errors uniformly across your application.

### Response Modification

It provides tools to easily modify and structure responses, ensuring a consistent API response format.

### "joi" Validation

Request body validation is achieved using the "joi" library, helping you validate and sanitize incoming data.

### MongoDB Integration

The boilerplate includes a connection to MongoDB, allowing you to easily interact with a MongoDB database.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Modify the configuration in `config.js` to match your environment settings.
4. Create your core functionalities within the `core` directory and your HTTP API modules within the `httpApi` directory.
5. Start your application using `npm start`.

## Configuration

Modify the configuration in `config.js` to set up your environment-specific settings such as database connection details, API keys, and other configuration parameters.

## Usage

Build your application by adding your core logic to the `core` directory and implementing your HTTP API modules in the `httpApi` directory. Leverage the provided features to streamline your development process.
